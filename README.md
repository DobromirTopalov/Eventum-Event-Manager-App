## App Description - https://eventum-event-manager-app.herokuapp.com/

Eventum is a standart web application for browsing, searching, managing(CRUD) events of different categories or types. There is a register system which allows you to sign up as an artist, or - user, otherwise you are treated like a guest. Guests can **browse**, **search**.Our users extends guest functionality with **purchase ticket option**, **cart**, **profile panel** where each user can change their info, as well check his event history or see his **checkout page** to buy tickets for his friends. What makes the artist more attractive is its control over events - **create**, **update**, and so on.

# Pages on site
  * homePage
  * search
  * login/register
  * profile/settings, and more.
  * create event, event-overview
  * checkout/cart
  * ...

Our application offers an easy to use, simplistic, tidy design. It is agile - gives responses to almost every condition possible (you can see it when clicked on buttons). Users can react fast and change inputs without losing correctly validated fields. There is image uploading feature in order to make our platform fancier and more appealing to the one using it.

UI and server-side source code can be changed fast and we can migrate to a different concept in a matter of time. All of this is possible because of the structure of the project and the loose-coupling of logic inside, based on MVC design pattern.

There are many ideas that still have not been implemented, but are going to be patched with future releases.
